# TECHIN510_Lab4
For today's class we'll assess your knowledge of the HTML, CSS, and JS reading assignments from last week. However, instead of a high-school style quiz, this will be a group activity.

Students will work in teams and will promote one of their team members to the role of "Dev Lead". This person will be responsible for ensuring the team submits the final deliverable.

Working under the direction of the Dev Lead, teams will understanding the requirements in the MDN assessments for HTML, CSS, and JS, and then work together to build a v1 of the solution which the team will demo to the class.
